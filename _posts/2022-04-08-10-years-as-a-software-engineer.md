The year 2022 marks the 10th year I've worked as a software engineer professionally.
There are lots of good memories, but I was noticing that I am starting to forget about the things I've done and learned.
This post is to archive the experience I had as a software engineer for the last 10 years or so.

## Beginning

I learned about Ruby on Rails in 2010 and read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) by Michael Hartl.
I became familiar with the basics of web app development. I started to have hope that maybe I can code a web app on my own.

## Vidyard (Sep 2011 - Dec 2011)

This was my first programming coop job. When I think back, I was really lucky to get this job.
Vidyard is now a pretty big company now in Waterloo, Canada, but at the time I joined, 
there were less than 10 people in the company. 
It was a small company, but the spirit was high. It was so fun working there. The founders cared greatly about everyone they hired.
They made me feel welcome and be part of the company, even though I was just a coop who will work they just for 4 months.
I saw the leaders of the company becoming important focal points in the Waterloo tech scene. 
They may be young and still inexperienced at the time, but they stood out among many founders coming out of Waterloo at the time. 

I learned a lot working just 4 months there. I learned to use javascript and jQuery more. I still was not good at using either, but
exposure to it was important. I also shipped a feature that was sending out emails using Mailgun API. 

Working at Vidyard helped me decide that I want to become a software engineer. This was the most important realization I had 
from working here.

## Rhapsody / Napster (July 2012 - March 2018)
