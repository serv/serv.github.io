I found out that someone who is a friend and a coworker passed away years ago,
and I didn't know about it until today. I felt bad that I hadn't tried to
reach out to him more when I had the chance. He was a sincere guy who was
always positive. It makes me angry that someone so good passed away when he
was just 23. All the possibilities and dreams he might have had, they are all
gone. He didn't even get a shot at life.

People talk about unfairness a lot. They complain about how things are so
unfair in life. I do too. In a way, this game called life is rigged. Some people
really have many advantages in life while other don't. You can rightly
complain about how life is unfair because it really is so. But what does that
get you? Nothing. It'll in fact mess you up even more. It'll weaken you and
keep you stagnant. If you notice you are behind, think about how you are
going to catch up.

In fact, a vast majority of people even if they are way way behind others,
if they are living a life, working hard, studying, striving to better
himself and others, they are trying. Everyday, you get another chance at life.
A chance some others don't have.
