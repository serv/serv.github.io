##tl;dr

- Mobile web sucks and mobile native apps are way better.
- HTML5 is not a Messiah.
- no one is really interested in making mobile web better.

Imagine that we are in 2020, 6 years away from now.

We wouldn't have quite gone boldly where no man had gone before in our 
universe, but we would have at least explored mobile experience tirelessly
by then. Thousands of photos apps would have been made. WhatsApp copies 
would have iterated upon iterations. First there was Angry Bird, then
Flappy Bird, then some more Angry Flappy Birds. Dead horses would be beaten
more than one can count. So much would have changed and improved, but one
thing still remains the same. Mobile web experience will likely still lag behind the native app experience.

Inability of browsers to take advantage of phone hardware has been stated
as a reason why mobile web is lagging behind the native app. But I cast
my skepticism cautiously.

[Changes in HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
in recent years have been absolutely mind blowing.
You can replicate native
app experience on browser (though it is not easy). HTML5 in many ways have
caught up to where native apps are right now. Optimization on browser for
mobile still remains as a difficult task, but so is developing for
native app. So what is dragging mobile web experience down?

## A Vicious Cycle

Mobile web development process is in a gridlock that continues to worsen
mobile web. The incentives for users, management and developers are all
uniformly against mobile web. Users have a preconceived notion that mobile
web sucks, and this belief is justified. It sucked for a long time, and even
today, it's not that great. Software companies are aware of this consensus
and devote less time and developer resources into making mobile web 
experience better. Mobile space for native apps, they say.
Web developers return the favor by creating a web app
that barely meets the minimum expectations set by the management. I want
web to win, but I am not optimistic about it.

Mobile web is suffering from a great stagnation. Effectively distributing
mobile web app to users are practical non-existent. Lack of standardized
monetization scheme hinders any development effort in mobile web. Much of
the web still remains apathetic to mobile users. Discovery process of mobile
web? What discovery process? And mobile web still feels clunky, slow and
off-beat. Mobile web experience is years behind native app experience. In
the age when a year represents an eternity of changes and improvements,
mobile web will not be able to attract users from native app for another few
years.
