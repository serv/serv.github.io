I started using Macs since 2011. My first Mac is 13-inch MacBook Pro from
Late 2011. It was a versatile laptop which I was happy to pay a slight
premium for. It served me well through out my school years and
it was a perfect development box.
It was ideal for light amount of gaming to destress as well. Over the years,
the machine started to wear out, it's become sluggish to the point where
I could no longer be productive anymore. It was time to look for another
laptop.

I considered purchasing a 2016 Macbook pro, but the specs were lagging behind
its contemporaries in the same price range. It used to be that I would be
paying 100 to 200 bucks more for the mac when compared to PCs that have
similar specs. Compare to that, now I was looking at paying from 400 to 700
bucks more for the mac. This was unacceptable. I decided to buy a PC instead.
For daily usage of web browsing and gaming, I planned to use Windows 10 and
for software development, I planned to use Ubuntu installed on the same
machine.

I decided to buy [Acer Aspire E 15](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DT4A2R4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for $509.99. This was an amazing bargain for a
laptop that has ok cpu, acceptable ram and usable discrete graphics card.
Also, the main harddrive offered is an SSD. The laptop comes with 4 USB ports
and a SD card reader which is perfect for me who wants to get into
photography.

I decided to upgrade 2 things hardware wise. First I wanted to increase my
storage. The machine comes with 250 GB SSD, but given that I want to play
games and store many photographs, I needed a larger harddrive. Also when
I partition the harddrive for Ubuntu, I wanted to leave myself at least 100 GB
for development. I bought [HGST Travelstar 7K1000 2.5-Inch 1TB](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4QESVQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for $61.99.
That left me with extra 1 TB of storage to play with.

Also another easy upgrade that I decided to make is doubling my memory.
I bought [Crucial 8 GB DDR 2133 MT/s RAM](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B015HQ9TGW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for $44.99.

Installations for these parts are extremely easy, and tutorials can be found
easily online.

And finally dualbooting Ubuntu on the machine requires some preparation, but
it's definitely doable and just having UNIX compatible terminal beats all
the effort required to set it up in the first place.

Overall, preparing a personal development machine that is able to play some
games at $616.97 was totally worth it.
