I have been using [ES2015 actively using Babe.js](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/)
and I was already convinced that compiling more dev-friendly language to
javascript is useful. One of the langauges that has been praised a lot in
this domain is [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html).
