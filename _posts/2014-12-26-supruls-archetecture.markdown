Since last July 2014, I started learning about
[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) for
[Soundtracking.com](https://soundtracking.com/)'s web client.
To learn more about Backbone.js and REST API/Client architecture,
I decided that I would spend the rest of 2014 working on creating a
[Delicious](https://delicious.com) clone.

Unfortunately, it is only about 50% finished, and I don't intend to complete it.
I achieved the initial goal of understanding these things and I feel that
I learned what I needed from this project. Big things I learned from this
project were:

- Creating REST API
- Creating single page app using Backbone.js
- Rolling out my own OAUTH2

You can check the project repos here.
