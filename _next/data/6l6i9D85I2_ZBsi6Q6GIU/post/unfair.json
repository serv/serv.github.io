I felt bad that I hadn't tried to\nreach out to him more when I had the chance. He was a sincere guy who was\nalways positive. It makes me angry that someone so good passed away when he\nwas just 23. All the possibilities and dreams he might have had, they are all\ngone. He didn't even get a shot at life.</p>\n<p>People talk about unfairness a lot. They complain about how things are so\nunfair in life. I do too. In a way, this game called life is rigged. Some people\nreally have many advantages in life while other don't. You can rightly\ncomplain about how life is unfair because it really is so. But what does that\nget you? Nothing. It'll in fact mess you up even more. It'll weaken you and\nkeep you stagnant. If you notice you are behind, think about how you are\ngoing to catch up.</p>\n<p>In fact, a vast majority of people even if they are way way behind others,\nif they are living a life, working hard, studying, striving to better\nhimself and others, they are trying. Everyday, you get another chance at life.\nA chance some others don't have.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
