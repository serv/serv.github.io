I copied\n<a href=\"https://github.com/koajs/koa/blob/master/benchmarks/run\">how Koa.js does its benchmark</a>.\nI prepared <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a>,\n<a href=\"http://restify.com/\">Restify</a>, and <a href=\"http://sparkjava.com/\">Spark</a> to be\nbenchmarked. You can see <a href=\"https://github.com/serv/framework-benchmarks\">the code hosted on GitHub here</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are the results of the benchmarks. The number represents requests / second.\nHigher is better.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>frameworks</th>\n<th>req/s</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>ruby on rails</td>\n<td>48.73</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>restify</td>\n<td>8117.63</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>spark</td>\n<td>32634.10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gOoneii.png\" alt=\"Web framework benchmarked\"></p>\n<p>I knew Ruby on Rails is slow, but I had no idea that it's this slow. And on\nthe other hand, I knew Java web frameworks are generally fast, but I had no\nidea that Spark is that fast! And Restify occupies a sweet spot between\nRuby on Rails and Spark.</p>\n<p>We can draw some conclusions from the findings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Spark for very highly trafficked microservices that requires requests\nto be served at low latency</li>\n<li>Use Restify for all kinds of backend API when you want to leverage a vast\ncatalog of Node.js packages and great development tools</li>\n<li>Reserve using Ruby on Rails for product oriented application only.\nI would not recommend Ruby on Rails for backend API that needs to\nserve a large traffic.</li>\n</ul>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
