I think we say this\nfor several reasons, but one big reason is to encourage the beginner that\nhe or she can solve the problem by reducing the perceived difficulty of the\nproblem. However, in reality, this probably has an adverse effect.\nFirst of all, it's condescending. It puts the beginner's confidence down.\nHe or she must be thinking, \"If this is so easy, why can't I do it?\"\nYou might even be wrong that it's an easy problem. There may be details of\nthe problem you haven't noticed yet that genuinely difficult problem\nlook very easy.</p>\n<p>I believe that you can omit saying \"That's easy,\" completely and help\nout someone effectively. Just treat problems beginners have as a problem\nyou and your colleagues have. Don't belittle the beginner with phrases like\n\"That's easy\" and just focus on what the problem is and helping them solve\nthe problem.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
