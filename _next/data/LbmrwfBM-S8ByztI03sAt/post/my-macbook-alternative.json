My first Mac is 13-inch MacBook Pro from\nLate 2011. It was a versatile laptop which I was happy to pay a slight\npremium for. It served me well through out my school years and\nit was a perfect development box.\nIt was ideal for light amount of gaming to destress as well. Over the years,\nthe machine started to wear out, it's become sluggish to the point where\nI could no longer be productive anymore. It was time to look for another\nlaptop.</p>\n<p>I considered purchasing a 2016 Macbook pro, but the specs were lagging behind\nits contemporaries in the same price range. It used to be that I would be\npaying 100 to 200 bucks more for the mac when compared to PCs that have\nsimilar specs. Compare to that, now I was looking at paying from 400 to 700\nbucks more for the mac. This was unacceptable. I decided to buy a PC instead.\nFor daily usage of web browsing and gaming, I planned to use Windows 10 and\nfor software development, I planned to use Ubuntu installed on the same\nmachine.</p>\n<p>I decided to buy <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DT4A2R4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">Acer Aspire E 15</a> for $509.99. This was an amazing bargain for a\nlaptop that has ok cpu, acceptable ram and usable discrete graphics card.\nAlso, the main harddrive offered is an SSD. The laptop comes with 4 USB ports\nand a SD card reader which is perfect for me who wants to get into\nphotography.</p>\n<p>I decided to upgrade 2 things hardware wise. First I wanted to increase my\nstorage. The machine comes with 250 GB SSD, but given that I want to play\ngames and store many photographs, I needed a larger harddrive. Also when\nI partition the harddrive for Ubuntu, I wanted to leave myself at least 100 GB\nfor development. I bought <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4QESVQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">HGST Travelstar 7K1000 2.5-Inch 1TB</a> for $61.99.\nThat left me with extra 1 TB of storage to play with.</p>\n<p>Also another easy upgrade that I decided to make is doubling my memory.\nI bought <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B015HQ9TGW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&#x26;psc=1\">Crucial 8 GB DDR 2133 MT/s RAM</a> for $44.99.</p>\n<p>Installations for these parts are extremely easy, and tutorials can be found\neasily online.</p>\n<p>And finally dualbooting Ubuntu on the machine requires some preparation, but\nit's definitely doable and just having UNIX compatible terminal beats all\nthe effort required to set it up in the first place.</p>\n<p>Overall, preparing a personal development machine that is able to play some\ngames at $616.97 was totally worth it.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
