But why?\u000b\u000b I conjectured a few reasons why.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You don't practice setting up deployments too often.</li>\n<li>When you do the setup, you usually mindlessly copypasta the command\nfrom internet.</li>\n<li>And you finally make it work without any deep understanding, well\nyou never try to relearn what you've done.</li>\n<li>Deployment is actually a hard subject that touches on many different\ncomplex systems.</li>\n<li>When something goes wrong, it's hard to fix or undo. And you might\ncompound the problem by trying to fix it by copypasta-ing even more crap.</li>\n<li>You might not even be aware of the problem at all. You could've done\nsomething an hour that fucked up the deployment process, but you might\nbe trying to undo something you did 10 minutes ago. Diagnosis of the\nproblem is really hard for deployment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What is the remedy for these problem?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have to practice deployment like everything else. In order to\npractice something you need a meticulous guideline on how to practice.\nThere for document everything!</li>\n<li>Understand each steps you are performing. Never just copypasta\nsomething. Even better, understand the system you are using.</li>\n<li>Even after you make something work, go back and review what you've\njust done.</li>\n<li>Learn the system you are using. Again, don't just copypasta.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I find that 5 and 6 are rather hard problems. You need really good\nunderstanding of the system in order to debug some problem.\nOtherwise, you just end up googling same shit over and over again.\nMaybe I'll come up with some solution for them later down the road.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
